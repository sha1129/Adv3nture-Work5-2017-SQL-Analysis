                SUM(SalesAmount) OVER(order by YEAR(OrderDate))
FROM FactInternetSales
ORDER BY YEAR(OrderDate);

-- SUM of sales by Sales Territory Group

SELECT DISTINCT st.SalesTerritoryGroup,
   SUM(s.SalesAmount) OVER(PARTITION BY st.SalesTerritoryGroup) AS Sum_OfSales_2013

   s.SalesTerritoryKey = st.SalesTerritoryKey

-- Window function is useful to find ranking 
-- This query will find ranking of customers which will display full names

SELECT DISTINCT TOP 10 s.CustomerKey, 
                CONCAT(c.FirstName,' ',c.LastName) AS FullName,
                SUM(s.SalesAmount) AS DollarSpent, 
                RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(s.SalesAmount) DESC) AS Ranking
FROM FactInternetSales s
JOIN DimCustomer c 
    ON s.CustomerKey = c.CustomerKey
WHERE YEAR(s.OrderDate) = 2013
group by s.CustomerKey, CONCAT(c.FirstName,' ',c.LastName)
