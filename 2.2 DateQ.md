# Queries working with date field

### Order Date Vs Ship Date Q1, 2013
```SQL
SELECT Distinct DATEDIFF(day,OrderDate,ShipDate) AS NumberOfDaysToShip
FROM FactInternetSales
WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) = 2013 and DATEPART(q,OrderDate) = 1
```
| NumberOfDaysToShip|
| ------------- | 
| 7  | 

All the orders take exactly 7 Days to process. We can look to reduce this to 5 days for faster processing. Improve efficiency
