# Queries to Analyze Overhead Costs and Employee effectivity

### Number of Employee
Can be found two ways, _Method 2_ learned from LinkedIn Learning Platform

#### Method 1
```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM DimEmployee emp 
WHERE emp.EndDate IS NULL
```
#### Method 2
```SQL
SELECT COUNT (1) NumberOfEmployee
FROM DimEmployee emp
WHERE emp.StartDate <= '2013-01-01'
    AND (
        emp.EndDate > '2013-01-01'
        OR emp.EndDate IS NULL 
    );
```
**Answer: 290**

### Number of Employee per department
```SQL
SELECT COUNT(e.FirstName) AS NumbOfEmpPer, e.DepartmentName
FROM DimEmployee e 
WHERE e.EndDate IS NULL
GROUP BY e.DepartmentName
ORDER BY COUNT(e.FirstName) DESC
```

 #### Mangers with their Department Names, Base Rate, and Pay Frequency  
```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT CONCAT (e.FirstName, ' ', e.LastName) AS FullName, 
    e.DepartmentName, e.BaseRate, 
    e.PayFrequency
FROM DimEmployee e
WHERE e.Title like '%Manager'
ORDER BY e.DepartmentName 
```

### Second highest paying person in the company 

To find this I used two methods and I prefer using the second method as we can get better information 

#### Method 1
```SQL
SELECT CONCAT (e.FirstName, ' ', e.LastName) AS FullName, 
    e.DepartmentName, 
    e.TITLE,
    e.BaseRate 
FROM DimEmployee e
ORDER BY e.BaseRate DESC
OFFSET 1 ROW FETCH NEXT 1 ROW ONLY
```
| FullName | DepartmentName | TITLE | BaseRate |
| ------------- | ------------- | --- | ----- |
| James Hamilton  | James Hamilton | Vice President of Production | **84.1346** |

By using OFFSET and Fetch I can sort the data and even find third highest based on the position

#### Method 2
```SQL
SELECT MAX(e.BaseRate) AS SecondHeightBaseRate
FROM DimEmployee e
WHERE e.BaseRate < (
    SELECT MAX(e.BaseRate)
    FROM DimEmployee e
)
```
Ans **84.1346**

_Important fact_ about second Method is that it will always find second highest without sorting query
