# Subqueries
### To learn sub queries, we need to first define the information that we need and what are we looking 
-For example To find: Cost of product vs sales amount
This is a good way to start as it involves two tables 

##### Query one: will find a list of product key/keys that have highest Production Cost
```SQL
Select ProductKey
FROM DimProduct
WHERE StandardCost = (SELECT max(StandardCost) FROM DimProduct)
```    
    
This above can be used as sub-query for faster finding of information

##### Query two: will find a list of product key/keys that have highest Production Cost in addition will find Sales amount and number of units sold
```SQL
SELECT distinct s.ProductKey, p.EnglishProductName, p.StandardCost, s.SalesAmount, count(s.ProductKey) as Number_of_ProductsSold
FROM FactInternetSales s 
JOIN DimProduct p ON s.ProductKey = p.ProductKey
-- PUT IN 
WHERE p.ProductKey in (
    Select ProductKey
    FROM DimProduct
    WHERE StandardCost = (SELECT max(StandardCost) FROM DimProduct)
)
GROUP BY s.ProductKey,p.EnglishProductName, p.StandardCost, s.SalesAmount
```
