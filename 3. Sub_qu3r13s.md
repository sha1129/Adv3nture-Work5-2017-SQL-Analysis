# Subqueries
### To learn sub queries, we need to define the information that we need to find

- for example To find: Cost of product vs sales amount
- This is a good way to start as it involves two tables 

##### Query one: will find a list of product key/keys that have highest Production Cost

    Select ProductKey
    FROM DimProduct
    WHERE StandardCost = (SELECT max(StandardCost) FROM DimProduct)
    
    
This above can be used as sub-query for faster finding of information

##### Query two: will find a list of product key/keys that have highest Production Cost in addition will find Sales amount and number of units sold

    SELECT distinct s.ProductKey, p.EnglishProductName, p.StandardCost, s.SalesAmount, count(s.ProductKey) as Number_of_ProductsSold
    FROM FactInternetSales s 
    JOIN DimProduct p ON s.ProductKey = p.ProductKey
    -- PUT IN 
    WHERE p.ProductKey in (
        Select ProductKey
        FROM DimProduct
        WHERE StandardCost = (SELECT max(StandardCost) FROM DimProduct)
    )
    GROUP BY s.ProductKey,p.EnglishProductName, p.StandardCost, s.SalesAmount
