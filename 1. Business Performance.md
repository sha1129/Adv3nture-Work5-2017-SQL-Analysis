# Adv3nture W0rks Business Performance
In this repo I will write series of quires to analyze business peroformance for the fictional store


### Number of Shipments made per Month

```SQL
SELECT COUNT (s.ShipDateKey) 'Number_Of_Shipment', DATEPART(m,s.ShipDate) as 'MonthNumb'
FROM FactInternetSales s
WHERE YEAR(s.ShipDate) = 2013
GROUP BY DATEPART(m, s.ShipDate) 
ORDER BY DATEPART(m, s.ShipDate)
```

### Territory that made the most Sales

```SQL
SELECT count(s.SalesTerritoryKey) 'NumberOfSale', st.SalesTerritoryRegion, st.SalesTerritoryCountry 
FROM FactInternetSales s 
JOIN DimSalesTerritory st ON s.SalesTerritoryKey = st.SalesTerritoryKey 
WHERE YEAR(s.ShipDate) = 2013 
GROUP BY s.SalesTerritoryKey, st.SalesTerritoryRegion, st.SalesTerritoryCountry
ORDER BY count(s.SalesTerritoryKey) DESC
```

### Top 20 Products sold in 2013

```SQL
SELECT top(20) p.EnglishProductName, count(s.ProductKey) NumberOfItemsSold  
FROM FactInternetSales s 
JOIN DimProduct p ON s.ProductKey = p.ProductKey 
WHERE YEAR(s.ShipDate) = 2013  
GROUP BY s.ProductKey, p.EnglishProductName 
ORDER BY count(s.ProductKey) desc 
```
From last query we know that **Water Bottle - 30 oz.** gotsold the most

### Region that sold the most Water Bottle - 30 oz. 

```SQL
SELECT p.EnglishProductName, count(s.ProductKey) NumberOfItemsSold, st.SalesTerritoryCountry
FROM FactInternetSales s
JOIN DimProduct p ON s.ProductKey = p.ProductKey
JOIN DimSalesTerritory st ON s.SalesTerritoryKey = st.SalesTerritoryKey
WHERE p.EnglishProductName like 'Water Bottle - 30 oz.'
GROUP BY st.SalesTerritoryCountry,s.ProductKey, p.EnglishProductName
ORDER BY count(s.ProductKey) desc 
```
US sold the most Water Bottle - 30 oz.



### TOP 10 Customers based on Dollar spent

```SQL
SELECT TOP !) c.CustomerKey, c.FirstName + ' '+ c.LastName AS FullName, 
    COUNT (*) AS NumbOrders,
    SUM(f.SalesAmount) AS TotalSpending
FROM FactInternetSales f 
JOIN DimCustomer c ON f.CustomerKey = c.CustomerKey
GROUP BY c.CustomerKey, c.FirstName + ' '+ c.LastName
ORDER BY SUM(f.SalesAmount) DESC;-- Customer with the highest sales total
```
### Top 10 Products based on Dollar made

```SQL
SELECT TOP 10 s.ProductKey, p.EnglishProductName,
    SUM(s.SalesAmount) AS TotalSales,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(s.SalesAmount) DESC) AS Ranking
FROM FactInternetSales s 
JOIN DimProduct p 
    ON s.ProductKey = p.ProductKey
WHERE YEAR(s.OrderDate) = 2013
GROUP BY s.ProductKey, p.EnglishProductName
```

### Products that were sold on promotions 

```SQL
SELECT s.ProductKey, 
    p.EnglishProductName,
    pr.EnglishPromotionType, 
    COUNT(s.ProductKey) CountOfTransactions, 
    s.SalesAmount, 
    p.StandardCost
FROM FactInternetSales s 
JOIN DimPromotion pr 
    ON s.PromotionKey = pr.PromotionKey 
JOIN DimProduct p 
    ON p.ProductKey = s.ProductKey
WHERE pr.EnglishPromotionType != 'No Discount'
GROUP BY s.ProductKey, p.EnglishProductName, pr.EnglishPromotionType, s.SalesAmount, p.StandardCost
ORDER BY COUNT(s.ProductKey) DESC
```

### Weekly Sales
```SQL
-- Note DATEPART function returns integer representation of the format given inside the brackets
SELECT SUM(ft.SalesAmount) AS 'WeeklySales', DATEPART(ww,ft.OrderDate) AS 'WeekNum'
FROM FactInternetSales ft 
WHERE YEAR (ft.OrderDate) = 2013
GROUP BY DATEPART(ww,ft.OrderDate)
ORDER BY DATEPART(ww,ft.OrderDate) ASC
```

### Running Total Q1 2013
```SQL
SELECT ProductKey,
    DATEPART(q, ShipDate), 
    SUM(SalesAmount) OVER (ORDER BY ShipDate RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS RunningTotal
FROM FactInternetSales
WHERE YEAR(ShipDate) = 2013 AND DATEPART(q, ShipDate) = 1

```

### Monthly Sales Total Oupted in formated Date
```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT DATEPART(mm,ShipDate) AS MonthNumb,
        format([shipdate],'MMM', 'en-US') AS MONTH,
        SUM(SalesAmount) AS Total
FROM FactInternetSales
WHERE  year(ShipDate) = 2013
GROUP BY format([shipdate],'MMM', 'en-US'), DATEPART(mm,ShipDate)
ORDER BY DATEPART(mm,ShipDate)
```
